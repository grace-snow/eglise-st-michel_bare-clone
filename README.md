# StMichel

This is a bare clone of [a repo by Thomas Roszak](https://github.com/TROSZAK/eglise-st-michel). He asked for help fixing the build via Frontend Mentor. 

My fix was to implement two build commands, following the Parcel docs - one for dev and one for production.

**Fixed** and now autp-deploys to netlify
